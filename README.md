#Fade
This project was relatively staightforward, only requiring that we get an the built-in led to fade on and off. The difficulty came in using a different language and editor than normal. Also, duty cycles were completely new and took me a little bit to grasp. This project didn't need any wiring.
#Servo
This project was also fairly straight forward for me. Using pulseio for pwm also took me a bit, but I got the servos working and also got the capacitive touch working. You can control the servo just by grabbing the end of a wire. Cool!
